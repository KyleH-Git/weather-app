## Description
This is a simple weather forecast app. Use it to find the weather of the input city.

## Usage
Enter a city name you would like the weather for in the search bar in the top left then click submit. The current weather will be displayed on the page with a 5-day forecast underneath. The searched city will be added to the city history underneath the search bar. Searching for a new city will add it to the history, and replace the currently displayed city weather information with the new cities. If you click a previously searched city in the city history section, it will redisplay the data.
